            content: `I find it utterly perplexing, the sheer incompetence of my \
            so-called "elite" stormtroopers! How is it possible that these bumbling \
            fools consistently miss their targets? Their aim is as precise as a blind \
            womp rat! I have invested countless resources into their training and armament, \
            yet they continuously disappoint me. Is it too much to ask for a modicum of accuracy? \
            Perhaps it's time to reevaluate the entire recruitment process, as this level \
            of ineptitude is simply unacceptable. These imbeciles couldn't hit the broad side \
            of a Star Destroyer if their lives depended on it! The galaxy deserves better, and \
            I demand nothing short of perfection from my troops.`
